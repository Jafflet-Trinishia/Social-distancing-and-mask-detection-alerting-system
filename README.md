# Social-distancing-and-mask-detection-alerting-system
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments worldwide to implement stringent measures to curb its spread, resulting in a halt to normal daily life. As months passed and infection curves began to flatten in some regions, restlessness grew within communities. In response, organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) provided guidelines to minimize virus exposure, emphasizing practices such as mask-wearing and maintaining a distance of approximately 1 meter (3 feet) from others. Several countries even enacted laws mandating mask usage, with private entities in other nations following suit. However, enforcing these crucial social distancing measures in large establishments has proven challenging.

To address this pressing issue, an automated system becomes essential. We have identified this need and developed a specialized model capable of real-time violation detection. Our model serves a dual purpose: first, it identifies whether individuals are wearing an acceptable mask, and second, it assesses whether proper social distancing is maintained between two people efficiently and accurately, requiring minimal oversight from authorities.

To implement our model effectively, we utilize object detection to identify three key classes: masked faces, unmasked faces, and individuals. While other models attempting to distinguish between masked and unmasked faces have favored object detection networks like the Single Shot Detector method, we have found that these approaches were not sufficiently efficient for real-time risk mitigation within communities.

Our model offers a practical solution to the challenges posed by enforcing COVID-19 safety measures in various settings. By automating the monitoring process, it enables organizations and authorities to more effectively ensure compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines, ultimately contributing to public health and safety during these unprecedented times.
